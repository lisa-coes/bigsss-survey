<td style="padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top;">For me personally, it was a great start to my academic life, and it also supported me while starting my PhD<br>I like the courses, but often it has been very unclear to fellows when and how classes happen. The information may be provided (though it also sometimes reaches the fellows quite late), but it does not always reach the fellows. As a result, people get disappointed in courses independently of the actual courses.<br>I would opt for a more voluntary approach, as some mandatory classes are not useful to individuals, and do it more like the demand-tailored classes. also, I think the proposal colloquium is helpful, but too much depends on the proposal (also psychologically), which means that we cannot start with the actual resebackground-color:#eeeeeeh until we have defended<br>Personally, I think an issue with the curriculum is how late the proposal defence takes place. Especially for fellows who have short funding periods, a significant amount of time and energy is invested in reworking the proposal and preparing for the defence, delaying the start of the actual studies, in the course of which the proposal tends to change a lot anyway. Maybe for some fellows it would be preferable to have the option to defend already during their first semester.<br>The Core Theory Seminar can include more diverse aspects, rather than only focus on CRC fellows' projects. The fellows can be included in the process of forming the curriculum of this course. 
Doctoral Colloquia is a good space for the fellows to share their papers and proposals, however, the lecturer Prof. Genschel did not read each proposal. He provides useful feedback when he reads the proposals but it is disrespectful and impractical for the fellows as they have limited time presenting and answering the questions which were already answered in the proposal. A lecturer able to give some guidance in qualitative methods as well would be more useful for the fellows in general.<br>The Curriculum is often flexible and demand-tailored, I like that. Unfortunately, courses are often announced only at the end of the semester and only at very short notice. This sometimes makes it impossible to plan vacations and resebackground-color:#eeeeeeh accordingly. As a result, regular scholars sometimes have difficulty catching up with the curriculum if courses are not offered appropriately. Personally, I have a rather hard time keeping track of what I already have and what I'm still missing in credits. <br>With regards to the methods courses, my answers are an average of all that I have attended so far. There have been some courses that I found extremely well organized and helpful but there also have been courses with quite poor organization and application, though these are very few. I have thoroughly enjoyed courses that have an applicative segment to them.</td>

<td style="padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top;">I do not think that Prof. Dr. Philipp Genschel takes his responsibilities as a chair of our colloquium seriously. He often says that he did not read the paper someone is presenting, which, of course, has an impact on the comments he gives. <br>Students understand and accept that supervisors have many work commitments and most of them are more pressing than supervision. However, I think that if supervisors got (just a little) training on how to communicate with students and give clear and constructive feedback many of the issues that students experience would improve. It can be frustrating to talk to your supervisor once every few months and each time receive contradictory advice because they forgot what they told you last time. Moreover (and I don't know if this is in BIGSSS' hands) perhaps supervisors should not be burdened with having to sign holiday applications and other types of administrative tasks.</td>

In the wiki this is often defined, but not practiced in the BIGSSS (or maybe it is just my strong need for clear structure). <br>The policies such as equal opportunities and admission are transparent until you get involved in the process as a fellow.

That is not a fault of those working in those structures, but as a consequence issues around structural inequalities are not receiving the attention that the much more diverse fellows desire and, in my view, deserve. And as much as BIGSSS with its limited means tries to provide additional support, the structural barriers are so massive that the BIGSSS could not overcome those without massive investment. International fellows struggle a lot more with all kinds of life questions beyond academia (visas for them and their families, health insurance, housing, discrimination in public life) that the wider university and BIGSSS offer only limited support for.</td>
